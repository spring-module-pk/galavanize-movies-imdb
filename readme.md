# The G Movie Database

Fans are crazy for movies and the G company would like to build an application for users to browse all the movies of the world!

Your team is to develop the specs and implement the API.

### Objectives

Use what you've learned about pair programming, the test cycle, and OOP to fulfill the acceptance criteria. 

Your final code should have:

1. No compilation errors.
2. No failing tests. 
3. Meet acceptance criteria.
4. API spec in the `README.md` of your repository.

**Tips**

Apply what you've learned so far.

- Follow TDD Practices
- Make sure your API follows RESTful principles
- Use SEAT to help write tests
- Use unit testing, integration testing, mocking, etc where appropriate
- Apply ZOMBIES for test coverage
- Let the Acceptance Criteria guide you, don't get caught up in over-planning
